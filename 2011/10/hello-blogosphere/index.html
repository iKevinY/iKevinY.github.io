		<p>After much consideration, I&#8217;ve finally decided to start a blog. One reason is to expand my writing skills (I don&#8217;t write nearly enough), but the main reason I&#8217;ve decided to do so is because I now have my own space on the Internet to write about, well, anything&nbsp;really.</p>
<p>I suppose this is the obligatory mini-biography post, so here goes. I&#8217;m a high school student living in Vancouver, Canada. I quite enjoy school, which I suppose is a good quality. I play the piano, and my favourite sport (to play) is Ultimate Frisbee, which is apparently very popular in the Pacific Northwest, something I wasn&#8217;t aware of until I started playing. Music is one of my passions, and I enjoy composing music in my free time. I&#8217;m also very interested in programming, and there&#8217;s quite a story behind how I became interested in&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>One Christmas, I got an iPod Touch as a present from my parents. It was a first generation iPod Touch, only running iPhone <span class="caps">OS</span> 1.1 at the time (it wasn&#8217;t even called iOS back then). It was an amazing device, but the issue was there were no apps for it. The concept of third-party apps wasn&#8217;t even existent. iPhone <span class="caps">OS</span> 1.1.3 added &#8220;Web Clips&#8221;, which were essentially pseudo-apps, or in other words, glorified bookmarks. What was truly amazing, though, was the release of iPhone <span class="caps">OS</span> 2.0. This <span class="caps">OS</span> update contained the debut of the App Store, and it was outstanding. The fact that you could find a game that looked interesting, buy it, and have it playable within a matter of minutes was mind-blowing. To put icing on the cake, the highly awaited games such as Enigmo and Super Monkey Ball were only $10 each, much less than games on any other console (although now, they&#8217;re $1 and $3 respectively; that&#8217;s a blog post for another time). Most apps and games were around the $3-$5 range at the time, and only your Apple <span class="caps">ID</span> password stood between you and a shiny new program for your&nbsp;iDevice.</p>
<p>When I learned that, unlike the other game consoles at the time, there was essentially no barrier to entry for programming iOS apps, I immediately checked it out. I downloaded Xcode and the iPhone <span class="caps">SDK</span> and messed around with it. I made very rudimentary apps, but nothing at all that was App Store-worthy. Eventually, I found a tutorial that explained how to make a basic Breakout-esque game, which I was pretty proud of. However, I soon realized that while I could follow a tutorial, I wasn&#8217;t able to code on my own. I took a break from Objective-C for a while, and got a book on C. I also bought the <span class="caps">PDF</span> version of <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>, and worked my way through it. While I&#8217;m gaining a better grasp on the concept of coding, I&#8217;m still nowhere near being a programmer; I&#8217;m slowly working on it though! As of now, I&#8217;ve decided to take a break with learning how to program, and instead focus on other things, like making this&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>After having the idea to start a blog, I researched various blogging platforms, but it quickly became evident that I should use WordPress. Between being open-source, having the ability to be a <span class="caps">CMS</span> as well as a blog, and having a native-iOS app that I can potentially contribute to in the future, I knew it was the right choice. I&#8217;m currently hosting my website with the great guys at <a href="http://laughingsquid.us/">Laughing Squid</a>, and here I am&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are a few things I still need to take care of. Firstly, I need a title for my blog. Something clever and funny, but not cheesy. (Or perhaps so cheesy that it&#8217;s funny and clever. Time will tell.) Personally, I quite like the look of the Twenty Eleven theme, even if it does gives off a <em>default blog</em> vibe. So far, I haven&#8217;t found any other themes that I particularly like, but I&#8217;ll keep looking. Perhaps I&#8217;ll even spring for a premium theme at some&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>So there it is, my attempt at a first blog&nbsp;post.</p>
