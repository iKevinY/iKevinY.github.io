Title: About Me
Slug: about

I'm a software developer and musician from Vancouver, Canada, and can be found most places online as [iKevinY](https://twitter.com/iKevinY). The colourful bird pictured in my avatar is the [lilac-breasted roller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac-breasted_roller).

These are some of the applications, websites, and technologies that I use on a regular basis:

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) -- source code editor with a wide variety of plugins available
- [GitHub](https://github.com) -- online Git-based project hosting
- [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com) -- hotkey-activatable terminal overlay
- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com) -- automatically adjust display colour temperature at night
- [Rainwave](http://rainwave.cc) -- video game music Internet radio station
- [Overcast](http://overcast.fm) -- podcast player for iOS

Here some books that I highly recommend reading:

- [Code](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735611319) -- Charles Petzold explains the design of computers and software in a manner accessible to even those without a background in computer science.
- [The Signal and the Noise](http://www.amazon.com/dp/159420411X) -- Nate Silver discusses how mathematical models created using probability and statistics are applied to real-world situations.
