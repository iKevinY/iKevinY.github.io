Title: About Me
Slug: about

I'm a software developer and musician from [Vancouver, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver), and can be found most places online as [iKevinY](https://twitter.com/iKevinY). I'm an honours CS undergraduate at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) with an interest in AI and machine learning. I was a software engineering intern at [Axiom Zen](https://www.axiomzen.co) in 2016 and at [Google](https://www.google.com) in 2017. Feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter!
