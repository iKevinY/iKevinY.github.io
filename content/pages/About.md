Title: About Me
Slug: about

I'm a software engineer from [Vancouver, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver). I graduated with an honours degree in computer science from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), and am currently working in Toronto at [Freshline](https://freshline.io), the future of food distribution businesses.

Prior to this, I spent three years working at Google, first in Kirkland, WA where I contributed to the [Asylo](https://asylo.dev) enclave framework and helped advance [Confidential Computing](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing), and later in Waterloo, ON where I improved the deliverability and reliability of Gmail.

In 2018, I interned at [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com) in Los Angeles, where I built a UI in React that provided a quick overview of the configuration state of any microservice in the fleet. This allowed rollouts of game patches to be made with a higher degree of confidence.

The summer before that, I interned at [Google HQ](https://careers.google.com/locations/mountain-view/) on an internal team that triages and curates feedback and bug reports for other various Google products. I worked on modifications to the app's Java backend to implement auditable changelogs.

My first internship was in 2017, where I worked at [Axiom Zen](https://www.axiomzen.co) in downtown Vancouver. I had the opportunity to work on several projects while there, ranging from machine learning experiments to full-stack development on new products.
