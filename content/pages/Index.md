<h2 style="padding-bottom: 10px">üëã Hi! I'm Kevin, or <code>@iKevinY</code> on most corners of the Internet.</h2>

I'm a software engineer from [Vancouver, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver). I'm currently working in Toronto at [MLSE Digital Labs](https://www.mlsedigital.com/) on software projects that power the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, Scotiabank Arena, and more. üçÅ

Prior to this, I spearheaded a product rewrite initiative at [Freshline](https://freshline.io), a Toronto startup streamlining food distribution. Before that, I spent three years working at Google, where I contributed to the [Asylo](https://asylo.dev) enclave framework, helped advance [Confidential Computing](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing), and improved the deliverability and reliability of [Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail).

I studied CS at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/), during which I interned at [Axiom Zen](https://www.axiomzen.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/), and [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/), and also TA'd [CPSC 320](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=320) twice, receiving the [2019 Undergraduate TA Award](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/award/2020/06/undergraduate-ta-awards-2019).

I also created [zeal.gg](https://zeal.gg/), a site for tracking the League of Legends ranked climb.
