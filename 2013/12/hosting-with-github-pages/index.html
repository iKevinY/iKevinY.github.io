		<p>Over the past couple of days, I made the switch to using GitHub as the hosting platform for my website by using <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. This felt like a natural progression as I already used GitHub for version control for the source of my website. I initially thought the move would be confusing and time-consuming, but after the <span class="caps">DNS</span> changes propagated, everything was up and running just as it had been before the&nbsp;move.</p>
<p>When dealing with User Pages with GitHub Pages, the hosted files must be located in the <code>master</code> branch of the repository. Since I didn&#8217;t want to have separate repositories for the source of the website and for the generated files, I opted to make an orphaned branch named <code>src</code> which would contain the source files. While I thought this would be complicated, it turned out to be quite&nbsp;straightforward.</p>
<p>Within the root directory of my website&#8217;s source, there is an <code>output</code> directory that the static site files generated by <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> go. Prior to using GitHub Pages, I had written a Bash script that would run the <code>pelican</code> command to generate the static site files and upload them using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>. Obviously, this script had to be rewritten, as in order to use GitHub Pages, changes need to be pushed to a Git repository rather than being uploaded to a web&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, there are two Git repository: one in the root directory of my website&#8217;s source and one in the output directory. Both remotes are configured to push to the same remote repository stored on GitHub. The local repository in the root directory has the <code>output/</code> directory in its <code>.gitignore</code> file and commits to the <code>src</code> branch while the <code>output/</code> repository commits to the <code>master</code> branch. While they are technically part of the same remote repository, each local repository is completely separate from the&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>I created an <span class="caps">SSH</span> key so that I do not have to manually authenticate every time <code>git push</code> is run by my site generation script. (Also because I have two-factor authentication enabled on my GitHub account.) While this did not work initially, it turns out that I was using the wrong remote <span class="caps">URL</span>; the proper <span class="caps">URL</span> to use over <span class="caps">SSH</span> (which in retrospect is quite obvious) is <code>ssh://git@github.com:user/repo.git</code>, rather than the <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> <span class="caps">URL</span> that is shown by default on the right side of the page when browsing the repository on&nbsp;GitHub.</p>
<p>While I use <a href="http://mac.github.com">GitHub for Mac</a> to manage the repository for the source files (the <code>src</code> branch), the repository for the <code>output/</code> directory is only modified by the site generation script. Making use of <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">GitHub Flavoured Markdown</a>, the commit messages in the <code>master</code> branch contain links to the most recent commit in the <code>src</code> branch. When viewing the <code>master</code> branch on GitHub, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"><span class="caps">SHA</span> hashes</a> automagically link to the corresponding commits in the <code>src</code> branch that generated the changes in the static site files, making it easy to determine what changes in the source files led to changes in the generated&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the script runs the following code after the <code>pelican</code> command generates the static site&nbsp;files.</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1

<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$outputDirectory</span>
git add -A
git checkout master
<span class="nb">read</span> -p <span class="s2">&quot;Extended commit message: &quot;</span> commitMessage
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -z <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$commitMessage</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Generated by </span><span class="nv">$commitHash</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
    git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Generated by </span><span class="nv">$commitHash</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> -m <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$commitMessage</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>
git push
</code></pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The command <code>git rev-parse HEAD</code> returns the hash of the last commit in the Git repository&#8217;s history and is stored in the variable <code>$commitHash</code>. The directory is then changed to <code>output/</code> and <code>git checkout</code> is run to ensure the branch that changes will be committed to is the <code>master</code> branch (not that it should change, but in case I were to accidentally change branches manually, this would prevents anything problematic from happening). Any changes made are then added via <code>git add -A</code>.</p>
<p>Following this, the script prompts for an extended commit message (what gets shown on GitHub after expanding the message). The first line of the commit message is &#8220;Generated by&#8221; followed by the hash of the last commit made in the <code>src</code> branch, and if an extended commit message is provided, the script will add it in. Finally, the commit is pushed to the <code>master</code> branch on&nbsp;GitHub.</p>
<p>All in all, this solution seems to work very well. I would highly recommend using GitHub Pages for static&nbsp;sites.</p>
