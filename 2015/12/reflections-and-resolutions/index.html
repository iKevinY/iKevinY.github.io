		<p>It&#8217;s already the last day of 2015, and I&#8217;ve only published a single post this year (and on the first of January, no less). It turns out I&#8217;m not actually limited to posting technical articles here, so I figured I would ramble on about various things from this year and set some goals for 2016. With any luck, this might even become a regular&nbsp;occurrence!</p>
<p>The computer science courses that I took this term were based around C and C++ rather than Java, and so thankfully I was able to forgo using an <span class="caps">IDE</span> for development. As a result, this also meant that I could ditch my Chromebook and pack even lighter. I decided to try using an iPad as my computing device because iOS 9 made multitasking a viable option, and it worked quite well. I was able to <span class="caps">SSH</span> into the department machines to write and compile code, which gave me the perfect excuse to learn Vim to some degree of&nbsp;competency.</p>
<p>I also spent the my most recent academic term applying for jobs through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_education">co-op program</a> at my university, and I&#8217;m excited about spending the next few months interning as a software engineer &#8212; quite the change in scenery from the perpetual lecture hall. If there&#8217;s one piece of advice I have for others applying for their first internships, it&#8217;s to <em>work on personal projects</em>. Not only do projects demonstrate your technical ability, but they also provide talking points for the more behavioural aspects of interviews. The important part isn&#8217;t so much that they&#8217;ve gone viral or are hundreds of thousands of lines of code long, but that you are able to discuss decisions you made and things you learned during the&nbsp;process.</p>
<hr>
<p>New Year&#8217;s resolutions are great because they&#8217;re arbitrary, and people inevitably forget about them. Sticking with your resolutions is generally good, though, so I&#8217;m hoping that by writing them in virtual stone, I&#8217;ll be pressured to follow through with at least some of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Writing is something that doesn&#8217;t get exercised very much as a computer science major. This is a shame, as communication skills are arguably more important now than ever. As a result, I write significantly less than I did in high school, which has led to what I perceive to be a decline in my articulacy. I have also noticed that I&#8217;m a &#8220;chronic lurker&#8221; when it comes to discussion-based sites like Twitter and Reddit, resulting in writing something, then promptly deleting it. Obviously, there is value to this when practiced in moderation, but I feel as though I self-censor a little too much. My personal theory is that there&#8217;s some level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)">perfectionism</a> to blame for this behaviour, and I&#8217;d like to correct it sooner rather than&nbsp;later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Time is the best censor, and patience a most excellent teacher.&#8221; <cite>Frédéric Chopin</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the remedy to this seems straightforward; I simply need to write more, and I have two fantastic venues for doing so: this website and Twitter. I&#8217;ll be making a concerted effort to do more writing this year, and &#8212; as Chopin says &#8212; let time do the&nbsp;censoring.</p>
<p>Another observation I&#8217;ve made is that extended, gapless music has become increasingly key to my bursts of productivity. When I&#8217;m not listening to podcasts, I tend to throw on an hour-long mashup or medley, since it allows me to better concentrate. I haven&#8217;t composed anything for years now, so this is yet another thing I&#8217;d like to focus on. The one quantifiable goal I have for 2016 is to release at least 30 minutes of music, which I&#8217;ll hopefully be able to transform into some sort of continuous&nbsp;mix.</p>
<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of the software industry is the emphasis placed on continual learning; there&#8217;s always a new language or technology cropping up. At times, this goes from interesting to overwhelming, but for the most part, it&#8217;s possible to filter out the extraneous. Apple&#8217;s open sourcing of Swift earlier this month was monumental for the <span class="caps">OSS</span> world, and contributing to Rust was a valuable learning experience for me as well. This year, I&#8217;d like to actually develop projects using these two&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>As it turns out, natural languages are pretty important as well for communicating with fellow Earth-dwellers. As far as language acquisition goes, the younger the better, so the best time to learn a new language is now, not later. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by Japanese due to the combination of logographic (kanji) and syllabic (kana) characters used in its writing system. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve learned a new language so I&#8217;m not sure how much progress I will make, but my final resolution for the new year is to begin learning&nbsp;Japanese.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to a great 2016,&nbsp;everyone!</p>
